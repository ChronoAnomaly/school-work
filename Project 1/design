Project 1 design

removeDuplicates:
  will be the same as unique expect when a different type of data is found, we will change the value of the data.
  
reverse:
  Node<T>* ptr will go through the list
  Node<T>* last = current head of the list. used to delete the values after we reverse the list
  
  while ptr is not null, make a new current head of the node ptr

sort:
  while the list is not sorted go through each node and look at the data
  if the data of the current node is > than the next node, then swap the data of the 2 nodes
