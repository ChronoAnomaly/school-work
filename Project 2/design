 
braided tree::

int next() and int prev()
  Check if the view node is currently the root: if so, then return saying that
the current tree is empty. If the tree is not empty, then convert the braided
node into a node and then use the node's class next or prev function.

int value()
  returns the value at the current node view is on.

void display()
  Start at the root node and traverse the linked nodes from smallest to
largest, printing each value until we reach the root node again.

boolean isFirst()
  Check if the view is on the root node or if it is on root->next, if not, then
return false.

boolean isLast()
  Check if the view is on the root node or if it is on root->prev, if not, then
return false.

boolean isHead()
  return view == root
  
boolean isEmpty()
  return root->rightChild == NULL

boolean find( int x)
  Travel down the tree looking for the value x. If the value is ever found, then
set found to true and set the view node to where x was found. If not, then leave
as false and set the view node to the root node.

int findMin()
  If not empty go to root->next and set the view to the node, also return the
value of the node

int findMax()
  If not empty go to root->prev and set the view to the node, also return the
value of the node

boolean insert( int x)
  If the tree is empty: create a new node with the value and set to the right
child of the root and update view to the new node
  Else:
