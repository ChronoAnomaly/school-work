SAT

bitset size is 1024, will make a 2d array based on how tracks there are.
basic bitset can hold 1024 tracks of information.


FAT

for setting up the FAT table size. check the total number of tracks and then
compare it to an exponential eq of 6^x where x incrases if the number of tracks
is larger than the result.  this will allow the table to be dynamic enough to
cotain a many small files as possible and keep the table size down on the disk.
