DESCRIPTION OF FILES
File     Accessible Description
-------- ---------- ---------------------------------------------
Makefile     Yes    A make file to simplify compilation.  The command
                    "make" with no parameters builds the driver.  Change
                    the line "OBJFILES =" to specify your object program
                    files.

                              *** HEADER FILES ***
disk.h       Yes    Definitions for the very low-level disk interface.
                    You do not need this for any reason except to
                    compile driver.cpp and disk.cpp.
driver.h     Yes    Definitions for the driver -- these agree with the
                    handout for disk simulation project.

                              *** SOURCE FILES ***
driver.cpp  Yes    Source for a driver program to aid you in testing
                    your disk program.
stub.cpp    Yes    A stub used to test the driver.  You might want
                    to use it as a starting point to save a little
                    typing.
disk.cpp    Yes    The low-level disk routines needed by the driver.
                    You do not need to access any of these routines
                    directly.

                            *** TEST FILES ***
TESTnn       Yes    The various tests are documented in message (M)
                    commands
FINAL      Not Yet  The turn in test input file for those who complete
                    the project.
